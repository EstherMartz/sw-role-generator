# Oh hai!
Deploying the StarWars role generator is quite easy, just:

`npm install
`
and
`bower install`

Then just launch gulp: 
`gulp`

And you're ready to go :)

(Please, just have in mind that you'll need npm, bower and gulp to deploy this app. It's quite obvious, but, who knows...)
